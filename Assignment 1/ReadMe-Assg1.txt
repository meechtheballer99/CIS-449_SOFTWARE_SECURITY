1) I used the SEED Ubuntu virtual machine (Ubuntu 20.04), using VirtualBox Hypervisor
2) I Downloaded and used the tarballs hw1.x.tar.gz from canvas (found under Files)
3) I Copied the tarballs into the “/home/seed/Documents/” directory of your VM using winSCP SFTP client
***Note that in CANVAS, I uploaded the MODIFIED compressed tar versions of these files that resulted from me completing the lab in the VM.***
To decompress (extract) the file contents of my assg1_complete.tar.gz file:
•	Run the command: tar -xvf assg1_complete.tar.gz (note, x flag is for “extract”)
•	This will extract contents of the tar file into the current directory of where the tar file is stored.
•	In my case, I created a directory called test , and made a copy of the tar file into that directory, then navigated to that directory and ran the command.
•	Then test directory has these contents after extraction of tar file:

4) I Decompress the tarballs using “tar -xvf” under /home/seed/Documents/” 
5) see my pdf/word doc of the report which has details and outputs of all commands I run
